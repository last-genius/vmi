# OS introspection

This module provides traits and structures for OS-aware introspection of
virtual machines. It allows for high-level analysis and manipulation of
guest operating systems, abstracting away many of the low-level details of
different OS implementations.

## Key Components

- [`VmiOs`]: The core trait for implementing OS-specific introspection
  capabilities.
- [`OsProcess`]: A process within the guest OS.
- [`OsRegion`]: A memory region within a process.
- [`ProcessObject`]: An opaque handle to a process in the guest OS.
- [`ThreadObject`]: An opaque handle to a thread in the guest OS.

## Usage

Implementations of `VmiOs` provide methods for introspecting various aspects
of the guest OS, such as enumerating processes, analyzing memory regions,
and extracting OS-specific information.

To use OS-aware introspection:

1. Implement the `VmiOs` trait for your specific guest OS.
2. Use the implemented methods to perform high-level analysis of the guest
   OS.
